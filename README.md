# The Biopython Suite
* [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) is a suite of software tools and Python packages designed for biological computation.
* The tools it provides have several applications in bioinformatics and computational biology.
* Biopython has libraries that can be used, among other things, for pairwise and multiple sequence alignment, protein sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree construction.
* This repository will demonstrate these functions through a series of short projects.
* The theoretical concepts behind some of these functions, such as pairwise and multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis and construction, have been taught as part of the curriculum of the course BIO213 Basics of Bioinformatics, offered by Ahmedabad University.
